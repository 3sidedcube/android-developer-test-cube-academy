# Cube Academy - Android Task

## Task
Every month, we select one team member as "The Cube of the Month". This member will be selected by votes from other Cubes. Each cube will be able to nominate their colleagues, and then we will tally the votes and select one of the nominees with the highest number of votes. 
You are responsible for building an Android app to make this process easier for our lovely cubes. 

### The app will include the following features:

-	A register/login feature for the user to register with their email address, or login if they have already registered. 
-	Create a nomination
-	View their current month's nomination
-	View the winner of the previous month

#### Useful links
- Designs: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/j9opgFDjgfmgsIcTpkvyEt/FED-Mini-Task-Flow?type=design&mode=design&t=cvBjihTJPiiIVaGK-1)
- API documentation: [OpenAPI docs](https://cube-academy-api.cubeapis.com/docs)

### API requests

Please read the [OpenAPI docs](https://cube-academy-api.cubeapis.com/docs) documentation before beginning.

You need to include an Authorization header to your API calls after you successfully register and login the user. The API uses a Bearer token for Authorization. 

### What do we expect from the app?
-	The app should demonstrate good use of Kotlin technologies.
-	We're looking for organised, clean, readable and documented code. Make sure you structure the files cleanly and define the classes and functions in a readable way. 
-	You're responsible for deciding which technologies and methods to use to bring the app to life. So choose wisely, you will be asked to defend your choices. 
-	Before reviewing the code, we start and test the app. So make sure you do enough testing to be confident of the app's performance. 
- Good use of Android resources (themes, dimens, styles, strings, colors, etc.)
-	Use git

### Bonus
#### The following points are bonus tasks. They’re not necessary, but we would love to see your take on them. 
-	Create a text document and write up other features that you think this app could use. What have we missed? Where have we gone wrong in our idea? What else would be useful?
  -	You can come up with ideas around the UX of the app, the API that we use, other methods in voting, logic issues, future problems or bugs, constraints, etc.
-	Automated testing - See where in your app you could use automated ui or unit testing. Of course, we don’t want you to force it, but if you feel like any part of your code could do with some testing, feel free to do so. 
-	Error handling - Try to implement a good error handling method for different possible errors the user might see from API errors to network or any other possible ones
-	Make sure your code has the least amount of warnings and errors in the logical, and also in the IDE (No unused variables, unused imports, obsolete code, etc.)


### The task will be marked on the following aspects:
-	Technical ability - How good the code quality is?
-	Attention to detail - How close does it look to the designs?
-	Organisational skills - How clean and readable the code is? 
-	Overall solution - does it accomplish the task and how well?
